# 28 July 2020
### Improvements
- Added additional mappings to [nist800-53-r4](frameworks/nist800-53-r4)
- Added machine-readable `config.json` file to the framework data folders. This file identifies the control framework, ATT&CK domain and version for the parsers and allows `make.py` to support mixed domains and versions between different sets of mappings. See issue [#15](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-control-framework-mappings/issues/15).
- [Added documentation](/docs/substituting_controls.md) on how to construct the ATT&CK Website and ATT&CK Navigator with controls taking the place of mitigations. See issue [#9](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-control-framework-mappings/issues/9).

# 15 July 2020
### Improvements
- Added additional mappings to [nist800-53-r4](frameworks/nist800-53-r4)
- Added a new utility script, [listMappings](util/listMappings.py), which creates a human readable list of mappings from the STIX mapping data. This script is capable of generating outputs in xlsx, csv, html, and markdown formats. See issue [#7](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/attack-control-framework-mappings/issues/7).
- Updated all scripts to allow the user to specify which version of ATT&CK to use.

# 25 June 2020
### Improvements
- Added additional mappings to [nist800-53-r4](frameworks/nist800-53-r4)
- Added flag to [mappingsToHeatmaps](util/mappingsToHeatmaps.py) to allow it to remove previously generated layers when run
### Fixes
- Fixed `domain` field formatting for layers generated by [mappingsToHeatmaps](util/mappingsToHeatmaps.py).

# 24 June 2020
### Improvements
